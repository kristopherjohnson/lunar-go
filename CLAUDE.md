lunar.c contains a C implementation of a classic Lunar Lander game program that runs in a terminal.  We will translate this program into Go.  Do not make any changes to lunar.c.

README.md contains a description of the C program. At the end is an example of the game's output. The alignment of the columns is very important: the Go version must format the output exactly as the C program does.

The Go program should be in a single source file named `lunar.go`. Also create the typical directory structure and project files for a Go program.

The README.md file should be updated so that the instructions for building and running the C program are replaced with instructions for building and running the Go program.
